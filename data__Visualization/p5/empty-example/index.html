    <p> Leaders of nations have addressed their citizens in response to the covid-19 pandemic. Despite the magnitude of the outbreak, political agenda remains prevalent in the actions and words of some leading figures.</p>
		<p>
	The data visualization extracts repeated terminology from these speeches, starting with the most repeated word (Coronavirus) to the least (Pandemic). The amount of times a word is repeated is represented by the size of the colour coordinated arcs, each of which is assigned to a country.</p>
